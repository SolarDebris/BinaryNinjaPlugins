# Binary-Ninja-Plugins
A collection of personal binary ninja plugins that I personally use.

## List Of Plugins
* *bn_jumpkeys*: This just adds some keybindings to move around the graph view with a keyboard.
* *bn_utils*: Just some random snippets that help in general
* *bn_patches*: Quick automated patches
* *linux_syscall_annotater*: A rewrite of an old plugin that annotates linux network system calls
* *my_taint*: A basic taint analysis that I am writing
* *bn_transfer*: A plugin that attempts to transfer analysis to similar bndbs to save progress.
* *Objective-C*: Just a plugin for analyzing objective c may or may not get to it
* *Rust*: A rust analysis plugin that i may or may not get to 

### Some Future Ideas
* *bn_source_something*: A plugin that will take source code and match strings and xrefs to create symbol names. May also reverse certain compiler flags. First target to probably be linux kernel.
